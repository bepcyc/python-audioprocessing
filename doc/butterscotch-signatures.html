                                Butterscotch.
                            </div>


                            <p>
                                A Butterscotch signature consists of at most 30 spectrum analyses, each
                                performed on consecutive 4-second blocks of audio, starting from the
                                onset of the first 5 dB RMS increase counted computed from 22-sample
                                blocks (when using a 44.100 Hz sampling rate).</p>

                            <p>Each spectrum analysis reduces each 4-second audio block to 256
                                equal-width frequency bands (using a 512-point FFT), then cuts the high
                                half of the bands, and finally averages the remaining 128 bands
                                logarithmically, to result in 8 log bands from the first significant
                                band to 11.025 KHz (the center of the highest frequency band is around
                                8.4 KHz). Each sample represents the relative signal amplitude, with
                                the reference 0 dB amplitude being equivalent to the value 1.0. Samples
                                in the spectrum analysis are not normalized to dB, but instead left
                                raw. Chunks supplied to the FFT are windowed by a Hann window.</p>

                            <p>As it turns out, the average of the correlation coefficient between
                                corresponding bands (across the time domain) among a set of songs is
                                surprisingly effective. Identical (non-rolling-start) songs correlate
                                almost perfectly regardless of start time differences, encoding bitrate
                                or even incompleteness. In contrast, different versions of the same
                                song and different songs correlate very weakly or negatively.
                                Additionally, the fingerprint has a very useful quality control purpose
                                too, as you will see graphically below.</p>

                            <p>
                                This is a graphical representation output of a spectrum in time -- not a Butterscotch
                                fingerprint, but you get the idea:</p>

                            <p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="Spectrumintime.png" alt="Spectrum in time">
                            </p>

                            <p align="left">Butterscotch itself does not work with dB-adjusted values, but the suite can
                                be used to perform spectrum analysis in decibels, in linear
                                (equal-width) bands and up to full-spectrum (22 KHz), for spectrum
                                plots:</p>

                            <p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="SpectrumintimedBadjusted.png"
                                                   alt="Spectrum in time (dB-adjusted)"></p>

                            <p>
                                Additionally, the suite can quantize these decibel-based points to a
                                character, and display a character-based table onscreen, in a sort of
                                very coarse, horizontal spectrogram.</p>

                            <p>
                                The algorithm's requirements specify that the algorithm:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Be robust against different "onsets of audible signal". If two
                                    different files contain the same song, and one of them has some extra
                                    silence at the start, that's not a problem.
                                </li>
                                <li>Be robust against identifying songs with rolling starts. A
                                    song in a megamix is not conflated with the same song's album / single
                                    release.
                                </li>
                                <li>Be robust against lossy compression. The 16~18 KHz lowpass
                                    algorithm in MP3 does not affect Butterscotch. A song encoded twice
                                    with different quality settings is reliably identified as the same
                                    song.
                                </li>
                                <li>Be robust against incomplete songs. Two copies of the same
                                    song (one complete, one incomplete) still correlate highly, and you can
                                    use your music player to weed out the shorter one.
                                </li>
                                <li>Be fast. A 20.000 song collection needs to be fingerprinted
                                    efficiently, and posterior analysis of the collection needs to be
                                    nearly instantaneous. Oops... we're working on that.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                To accomplish these, the algorithm:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>vectorizes all operations as much as possible,
                                </li>
                                <li>discards frequencies above 11 KHz,
                                </li>
                                <li>seeks to onset of audio by identifying the first RMS rise in a very short time
                                    frame,
                                </li>
                                <li>does not perform FFTs until end of audio, but just for two minutes.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The drawback of the algorithm is that it requires an
                                explosive (quadratic time) amount of correlations. Finding tracks
                                similar to one song is an O(N) operation. However, correlations can be
                                computed incredibly quickly (less than a millisecond for a pair of
                                signatures) and cached for future on demand use, so for collections
                                below 50000 tracks it's not a problem.</p>

                                    but the command line tools do)
